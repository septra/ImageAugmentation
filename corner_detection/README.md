Card corner detection 
==

Script for producing synthetic datasets to detect the corners of cards (ID, driving licenses, etc.)

The cards are augmented and superimposed onto backgrounds with an arbitrary rotation angle. The predicted values for this problem are the
actual corner co-ordinates of the cards instead of bounding boxes.
